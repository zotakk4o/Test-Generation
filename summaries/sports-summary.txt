Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running, jumping, and throwing.
The name is derived from the sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and some of the jumping events take place.
Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking.
The foot racing events, which include sprints, middle- and long-distance events, race walking and hurdling, are won by the athlete with the fastest time.
Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump, high jump and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put, javelin, discus and hammer.
There are also "combined events" or "multi events", such as the pentathlon consisting of five events, heptathlon consisting of seven events, and decathlon consisting of ten events.
In these, athletes participate in a combination of track and field events.
Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor; the most prominent team events are relay races, which typically feature teams of four.
