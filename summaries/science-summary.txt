All living things can be divided into two main groups: the Animal Kingdom and the Plant Kingdom.
There are many different kinds of creatures in the Animal Kingdom, and there is a scientific system for grouping animals into smaller and smaller groups that are more and more similar.
The ranking of the different subdivisions is shown in the examples of four different animals in the following chart, Examples of the Scientific Classification System.
The genus and species names are italicized, and the two names together are the scientific name of the animal.
There are 15 phyla of animals, and each phylum contains animals that have a combination of characteristics that animals in other phyla do not have.
The phylum Arthropoda are the animals with jointed legs, segmented bodies, and a tough or hard outer covering that also serves as their skeleton (exoskeleton).
The class Insecta, or insects, are the Arthropoda that have three pairs of legs, a segmented body divided into three regions (head, thorax, and abdomen), one pair of antennae and, usually, wings.
