Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves, fruits, or wood.
Some species are parasitic, and may vector diseases.
Some insects perform complex ecological roles; blow-flies, for example, help consume carrion but also spread diseases.GAPS => []
Insect pollinators are essential to the life cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of the biosphere would be devastated.GAPS => []
