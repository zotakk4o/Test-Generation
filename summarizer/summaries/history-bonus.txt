World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China .
World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations on Germany by France and the United Kingdom .
The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts ; the victorious great powers—China , France , the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom , and the United States—became the permanent members of its Security Council .
