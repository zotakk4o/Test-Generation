1--Insects that undergo three-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages.
2--As it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles, composed of the front & rear on one side with the middle on the other side.
3--Many insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit.
4--Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae.
5--Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in).
6--Nearly all insects hatch from eggs.
7--Insects are the most diverse group of animals; they include more than a million described species and represent more than half of all known living organisms.
8--Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances.
9--Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water, with larval adaptations that include gills, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming.
10--As used here, the term Insecta is synonymous with Ectognatha.
11--The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo four-stage metamorphosis.
12--Lampyrid beetles communicate with light.
13--Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, which are dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.
14--Humans regard certain insects as pests, and attempt to control them using insecticides, and a host of other techniques.
15--Some insects perform complex ecological roles; blow-flies, for example, help consume carrion but also spread diseases.
16--Definitions and circumscriptions vary; usually, insects comprise a class within the Arthropoda.
17--Some insects, such as earwigs, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young.
18--The total number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million; potentially over 90% of the animal life forms on Earth are insects.
19--Other species communicate with sounds: crickets stridulate, or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males.
20--The higher level relationship of the insects is unclear.
21--Silkworms produce silk and honey bees produce honey and both have been domesticated by humans.
22--Some species are parasitic, and may vector diseases.
23--Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves, fruits, or wood.
24--Adult insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming.
25--Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways.
26--The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants.
27--Insects are consumed as food in 80% of the world's nations, by people in roughly 3000 ethnic groups.
28--Insect pollinators are essential to the life cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of the biosphere would be devastated.
29--Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts.
30--Insects or Insecta (from Latin insectum) are hexapod invertebrates and the largest group within the arthropod phylum.
31--Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight, and all flying insects derive from one common ancestor.
32--Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain bees, ants and termites, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies.
33--Some species, such as water striders, are capable of walking on the surface of water.
