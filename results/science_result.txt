1--The class Insecta, or insects, are the Arthropoda that have three pairs of legs, a segmented body divided into three regions (head, thorax, and abdomen), one pair of antennae and, usually, wings.
2--The ranking of the different subdivisions is shown in the examples of four different animals in the following chart, Examples of the Scientific Classification System.
3--For example, the scientific name of the house fly is Musca domestica.
4--There are 15 phyla of animals, and each phylum contains animals that have a combination of characteristics that animals in other phyla do not have.
5--This method of classifying animals is used by scientists.
6--Insects have these characteristics, so they belong to Phylum Arthropoda, but so do millipedes, spiders, ticks, crabs, lobsters, and crayfish, which are not insects.
7--Other common classes of Arthropoda are Crustacea (such as sowbugs, crayfish, crabs), Diplopoda (millipedes), Chilopoda (centipedes), and Arachnida (such as spiders, ticks, mites, scorpions).
8--Other Arthropoda classes have more than three pairs of legs and only one or two body regions, and they never have wings.
9--The genus and species names are italicized, and the two names together are the scientific name of the animal.
10--The Animal Kingdom is first subdivided into groups called phyla (singular: phylum).
11--The phyla are divided into "classes," the classes into "orders," and so on until we get to the smallest division called species.
12--There are many different kinds of creatures in the Animal Kingdom, and there is a scientific system for grouping animals into smaller and smaller groups that are more and more similar.
13--The phylum Arthropoda are the animals with jointed legs, segmented bodies, and a tough or hard outer covering that also serves as their skeleton (exoskeleton).
14--All living things can be divided into two main groups: the Animal Kingdom and the Plant Kingdom.
